## Introduction
> This book is about how real people have created full lives.

The objective of this book is to show examples of how real people can lead _good, full lives_ with the 168 hours available to each of us (through time logs) every week and to study these in order to draw some lessons from these examples.

_Note: The book is dotted with a large number of detailed time logs throughout. They're pretty interesting (and will not be reproduced in these notes) so I'd recommend getting your hands on a copy to flick through them._

## Chapter 1 - The Mosaic Project
> There are 168 hours in a week. If you work 50 and sleep 8 per night (56 hours per week in total), that **leaves you 62 hours** for other things. If you work 60 hours and sleep 8 hours per night, that **leaves 52 hours for other things**.


This chapter goes into detail about the setup of the study (called the Mosaic Project), data collection, assumptions and why certain metrics were chosen. It also discusses where the data falls down, particularly in terms of not being a fully representative sample of high-earning women with children. 

+ The Mosaic Project studies the time logs of **143 women** who:
  + Earn more than $100,000 USD a year
  + Have 1 or more underage child living at home
+ **Time logs > surveys** because simply _asking_ people how they spend their time produces _unreliable answers_
+ Author found hour blocks were too long as they didn't provide enough detail in the logs but 15 minute intervals (or less) discouraged people from filling them in
  + **30 minute intervals was the sweet spot for time log entries**

+ It's all about perspective and your attitude
+ Time studies show people seldom work more than 60 hours _every_ week, even if they say they do
  
There will be crashed rushed times with no sleep alongside time spent [doing what you love](http://www.dwyl.io). The key is to **look at your time log (the mosaic) as a whole, not just at the individual time slots (tiles)**.

## Chapter 5 - Be There
+ An unexpected outcome of keeping a time log was that a lot of the women found out they also spent the equivalent of a full time job's worth of time with their family
+ _Noted that being **around** family is not the same as being **with** them_

### "10 Secrets of Happier Parenting"
_Note: Some of these are very applicable to home life in general - I didn't read the ones that were very specific to children in detail_

1. **Think through your weekday evenings**
  > Planning a little bit means we're not just going straight from work to staring at the TV to bed.    
  
  + If you have a big block of time with family (3-5 hours say), **plan for it, even if it involves a mealtime** otherwise you end up frittering the time away with household tasks or TV or checking email absentmindedly _(you would plan for this time if it was work time remember)_
  + p. 129 includes some ideas for what to do with your kids after dinner
+ **Think through your mornings**
  + Get up 30 minutes before anyone else in the house for 'me time'
  + **Don't just make your mornings about getting out the door**, try to spend at least an hour of quality time with spouse/kids/yourself; there will eventually come a moment when you have to make a move to get dressed and out the door but it _doesn't have to be the focus of your entire pre-work morning_
+ **Play**
  > Most of us could stand to increase the fun in our lives. [...] Yes, you need [to buy] garbage bags. But you can fit that around the playing rather than the other way around.
  
+ **Share a family meal (not necessarily dinner)**
+ **Let the kids know what you do all day**
  + You enjoy seeing where your kids spend their days, so they'll also enjoy seeing how you spend yours - let them visit you for an hour at the office [it'll make your job more real for them too]
+ **Chaperon kid excursions**
+ **Go one-on-one when you can**
  + Spend some time alone with each of your kids (going on 'dates' or joining an activity like a book club or climbing club which is just the two of you)
  + If you have more than one kid and no partner/childcare possibilities for the other one, consider picking one up from school a little earlier and spending an hour before picking the other one up
+ **Exercise together** ("it's a well know mood booster")
+ **Plan adventures** [together]
  + Make a **"List of 100 Dreams"** or an **"Annual Family Fun List"** as a family where each family member contributes some items
+ **Give yourself credit**
  + Understand that as a parent you will always be tired so you might as well be tired watching your kids play at the beach than slumped on the sofa listening to them whine and bicker.
  
### "How to Nurture your Romantic Life"
+ Spending adults-only time with husbands and partners is **essential**
+ Remember **date night doesn't have to be at night**

### "Go All In"
1. **Seize the opportunities that come your way** even when life feels insane
  + No way you're too busy to give your partner a real hug and kiss before you leave the house
  + Rather than rushing out, make a conscious decision to spend 5 minutes playing with your kids, making silly faces etc before you leave
2. **Savour the moments** when they appear
> Life is stressful and life is wonderful. There is no contradiction here. These facts exist side by side. We simply need to learn to see them as they are.

  + "Observation breeds mindfulness" which is why tracking your time really helps you notice the small things

## Chapter 6 - Make Life Easier
+ Opens with really refreshing take on time (not one of someone haggard from never having time to do anything) from Lynda Bascelli, who's the busy medical director for a center for the homeless with 2 kids - it's **all about attitude**:

> Finally, "we let go of a lot of stuff". Her seven year old goes to school in "whatever she chooses to put on". [...]   
It also stems from her work. **The patients she sees have problems that make freaking out over household logistics seem stupid.**

+ The average woman in the study spent around _10 hours a week on housework_, but it ranged from 2 hours to over 25 hours, taking up entire days!
+ **Recognize that much of what fills our time is a choice**

> If you make a habit of doing laundry daily, you'll end up doing laundry daily whether it really needs to be done or not. [...]    
And so, the **time logs that showed admirable organization** - morning cleaning rituals, weekend meal planning - were also the logs with the **highest total number of housrs spent on household tasks**

#### Some suggestions to "make life easier":
+ If you're going to outsource cleaning tasks, make sure you outsource frequent tasks like laundry, dishes and ironing which take up most time
+ A **good way to frame helping with housework for kids** is to explain the money you save in not hiring outside help for those chores goes towards other family priorities like your adventures together
+ You can get most household items (especially recurring ones) delivered
+ Figure out a small list of healthy, quick dinners and then keep staples around to make them (no meal planning required)
+ Make chores fun
  + Score quality time with your kids whilst running errands
  + Make a shopping trip into a scavenger hunt where the aim is to find things as quickly as possible
+ **Most importantly, learn to let go**
  + If you're bothered by the 3 dishes in the sink that need washing, that half hour you'd set aside for reading is chopped up and disappears
  + If someone takes something off your plate and give you back that time, let go of it having to be done _your_ way
  
_Note: There was also a portion of this chapter called "The Childcare Dilemma" which I didn't read._
