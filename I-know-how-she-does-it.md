## Introduction
> This book is about how real people have created full lives.

The objective of this book is to show examples of how real people can lead _good, full lives_ with the 168 hours available to each of us (through time logs) every week and to study these in order to draw some lessons from these examples.

_Note: The book is dotted with a large number of detailed time logs throughout. They're pretty interesting (and will not be reproduced in these notes) so I'd recommend getting your hands on a copy to flick through them._

## Chapter 1 - The Mosaic Project
> There are 168 hours in a week. If you work 50 and sleep 8 per night (56 hours per week in total), that **leaves you 62 hours** for other things. If you work 60 hours and sleep 8 hours per night, that **leaves 52 hours for other things**.


This chapter goes into detail about the setup of the study (called the Mosaic Project), data collection, assumptions and why certain metrics were chosen. It also discusses where the data falls down, particularly in terms of not being a fully representative sample of high-earning women with children. 

+ The Mosaic Project studies the time logs of **143 women** who:
  + Earn more than $100,000 USD a year
  + Have 1 or more underage child living at home
+ **Time logs > surveys** because simply _asking_ people how they spend their time produces _unreliable answers_
+ Author found hour blocks were too long as they didn't provide enough detail in the logs but 15 minute intervals (or less) discouraged people from filling them in
  + **30 minute intervals was the sweet spot for time log entries**

+ It's all about perspective and your attitude
+ Time studies show people seldom work more than 60 hours _every_ week, even if they say they do
  
There will be crashed rushed times with no sleep alongside time spent [doing what you love](http://www.dwyl.io). The key is to **look at your time log (the mosaic) as a whole, not just at the individual time slots (tiles)**.
