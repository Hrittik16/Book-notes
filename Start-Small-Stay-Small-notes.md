#Chapter 1 - The Chasm Between Develop & Entrepreneur

Seeking *venture capital creates 2 kinds of problems*:
1. Massive investment of time and focus away from things like your product and staying in business
2. Eliminates the option of 'modest succes' by forcing you to pursue much bigger markets immediately to get a good return on investment

* No venture capital equals organic growth through re-investment of profits and therefore offers a lower risk.

* **Niche markets are critical** - they're too small for large competitors and always underserved.

#####Product last, marketing first.
* Your product has to be good but you need to *know if people want it _before_ you build it*.
* *Goals* should be written down and publically communicated and you should be accountable to someone - you accomplish significantly more by writing a weekly email with your progress to a friend than you would without this.
	* This is crucial to keep you motivated during difficult times

#####Good short-term goal suggestion: "Strive to build a startup that generates Â£500 a month in profit."

* Do remember there is a burden of **support** required once you release a product

_Most common roadblocks:_

1. _**No market:**_ product-first approaches only occasionally works (rarely) - test the _validity of your market *first*_.

2. _**Fear:**_ The fear that "stands between you and your goal is something 99.9% of people will never overcome" and it's a good indicator your *going to grow as a person if you get through it*.

3. _**Lack of goals:**_ Having goals makes decisions more clear cut, without them you're flying blind. Have and *write them down* (long term AND short term).

4. _**Inconsistency:**_ Be wary of time wasting masquarading as productivity - instead of looking for 50 blogs to market to, could you maybe look for 10 with the same effect? Or spend half that time writing out a brief for your virtual assistant (VA) to do it? *Limit* your information consumption, make sure what you're doing for that hour is getting you 1 hour closer to launch.

5. _**Believing you have to do everything yourself:**_ Linked to the above - some things are fun even, but you can outsource them a to VAor other professional to save time -> start with outsourcing non-critical tasks until you're comfortable with contractors.

#####Dollarize your time, so that there's no doubt whether something is worth outsourcing or not.

*How?*
1. Base it on freelance rates
2. Base it on salary & benefits

* _Step 1:_ realise your time is worth $x /hour
* _Step 2:_ actually generate $x /hour
* _Step 3:_ figure out how to make it be worth more!

**$100 an hour is a good long-term goal.** If you're only making $25/hour you're doing something wrong.
* You won't be earning $50/hour when you start but should aim to hit that figure _within 6 months of launching_

#####Ask yourself: "At this very moment, am I making progress towards crossing off a to-do or am I relaxing & re-energising?"
* Both are ok, but don't waste time on un-enjoyable activities. _If you're at the movies and you're finding it boring, walk out._
* **Never find yourself killing time** - every non-work, non-leisure minute spent is a money waster, so carry a notebook with you everywhere.
* Remember that _information consumption_ is only ever good when it produces something so *always take notes* and make sure you take action on them!
* Being a good developer is not enough: in Michael Gerber's 'E-myth Revisited' there are 3 archetypes of running a business:
	* _Entrepreneur:_ visionary, long term goals
	* _Manager:_ ROI and productivity
	* _Technician:_ gets work done

> Market comes 1st, marketing 2nd, aesthetics 3rd and functionality a distant 4th.

#Chapter 2

The key is that **people must be willing to pay for your product** - market first.

Always _go for a niche market_ because:
* It narrows focus of your product
* Niche advertising is more cost effective
* Less competition
* Higher profit margines because you're solving a _very specific_ problem
* Niche markets are not used to good marketing so you'll have an advantage
* Easier to be trusted - small enough niches mean you'll see each other around more

**Create a list** of hobbies/interests and put names of people you know against each one - these are your _'warm niches'_.

**Find your niche:**
1. Examine your hobbies, interests and work
2. Scan through a list of occupations and check if you have experience or contacts with them

> Creating demand is very, very expensive whereas filling demand is, by comparison, cheap.

* **Is there a magazine for your market?** Then it's probably large enough to have enough customers and if you can advertise for less than $5k, you can probably reach them
* Remember that *being on the front page of Digg or Buzzfeed* is inconsequential if this isn't your market and it won't convert into sales

#####*Go for vertical markets* over horizontal ones:
* People in verticals have similar behaviours
* They 'hang out' together and talk to one another
* They have similar needs

####MEASURING DEMAND
**Free:**
1. _Google Adwords keywords tool_ - to find possible keywords
2. _SEO Logs keyword difficulty tool_ - to see how difficult it is to rank for them
3. _Actually check google_ as free tools are pretty bad estimators

**Doing it for <$100:**
- Set up a mini sales site and take out an ad on Google Adwords
- Assume a 2-5% conversion for free trials and 40% conversion for people who click 'Buy Now' on your site

#Chapter 3 - Your Product
Product Success Triangle - each of these has _equal weighting_:
* Product
* Market - people willing to pay for it
* Execution - marketing, selling and support

Your first product should take between **200 and 400 hours**.
	- Consider whether it's worth _hiring out_ people to build your product, especially if you have a day job

**Pricing Model** (product categories):
* Dealing with _hobbies_: max $29 fixed price or $14/month
* _Consumer time-saving products:_ max $49 fixed or $19/month
* _Small businesses with serious pain point:_ $400 fixed or $99/month
* _Larger businesses:_ max $1000 fixed or $199/month

**Tips:**
- Determine product's value in savings
- Lean towards higher pricing
- Know what people can spend without further approval
- Use 3 tiers of pricing
- Potentially charge fixed fee on-off plus 20% of that for support annually
- _Test pricing models_

**TESTING PRICE**:
* _Sales cycle < 1 week:_ Change your price for 1-2 weeks with no notifications and watch effect on revenue
* _Sales cycle > 1 week:_ Increase price but offer to mailing list at old price for 7 days, then after a few weeks, check if revenues have increased. Then decrease price and watch revenue. If no change, back to original price.

#Chapter 4 - Building a Killer Sales Site

The **sales funnel** where the chances of converting people who see your URL into buyers are slim:

\ 	People who see your URL	 /
 \						|							/
  \ 	 Click your URL			 /
	 \					|						/
	  \  Potential client  /
		 \				|					/
		  \			Buyers		 /
			 \							/

* **Don't plan to sell to a customer on their first visit**
	* Convincing someone to _give you their email address is much easier_ than convincing them to buy your product
	* Establish _trust_ and give them a _reward_ for signing up to your mailing list

**Know your customer:**
1. What keeps them awake at night?
2. Top 3 frustrations?
3. What do they desire most?
4. How have people who have tried to sell them something similar failed or succeeded?

_Any_ page they land on should have a prominent call to enter their email address.

The key pages are Home, Tour, Testimonials, Contact Us and Purchase + Pricing; they should all be accessible with **at most 2 clicks** from anywhere else.

To **find your hook**:
* Explain what your product does and for whom?
* Promise benefit to customers, e.g. 'Save time. Get paid faster.'
* Feature - the single most remarkable feature of your product

**Email marketing tips**
- Test yourself but usually emails on _Tuesdays, Wednesdays & Thursdays_ are best, between _07h00 and 10h30_
- _Never send attachments_ - link to files if you have to
- Subject line should be _under 7 words_
- _One goal_ for each email - relationship building or call to action: sales should only happen every 4th or 5th email.

#Chapter 5 - Startup Marketing

You want **quality traffic** (visitors close to your ideal customer) as opposed to just 'traffic'.

What will sustain a business:
1. A mailing list
2. Blog, podcast or video blog
3. Organic search
	 Everything else is _suplemental_ traffic.

**Mailing list**
A mailing list should be the _number 1 goal of your website_.

Content:
* Monitor current events + help keep your customers up-to-date
* Answer FAQs from users in your newsletter
* Short email interviews with a customer
* Hire a writer occasionally to put together an article on a relevant topic

**Blog, podcast or video blog**
For blogs, if you don't have unique insight or expertise, partner with someone who does.
> Cater to both humans and search engines.
Blogs and mailing lists _don't even come near the level of engagement of podcasts_ - if you want to get into this, just start with 'Podcasting for Dummies' [or [this simple post on how to launch a podcast from Elise Blaha Cripe](http://eliseblaha.typepad.com/golden/2014/04/how-to-launch-a-podcast.html)]

**Organic Search**
SEO has two components - on-page factors and incoming links
* _On-page factors:_ page titles, meta tags, URL structures, etc. Learn about this in 'SEO: an hour a day'.
* _Incoming links:_
	* Ideal links are from older sites with high page ranks
	* Make sure you avoid setting off red flags by:
		* Focusing 50% of your text on key search terms and vary other between 3-5 terms
		* Building links slowly and steadily
		* Staying away from link farms

_Link Building:_
1. Submit to directories (like DMOZ and Gimpsy) and local directories
2. Use Yahoo Site Explorer to check who is linking to your competitors, they'll be interested in you too [which has now been merged into [Bing Webmaster Tools](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster)]
3. Set up **google alerts** for your and your competitor's product names
4. Publish 500-700 word articles to repositories
5. Offer **free versions** of your product to **academic** & **NGO** institutions
6. Offer to write a testimonial for a company whose product you use for a link back to yours.

#Chapter 6 - Virtual Assistants & Outsourcing
>Performing tasks you could pay someone else $6 to accomplish is a foolish use of an entrepreneur's time.
**Big thing:** workgin on a small team, you can't afford to throw away time.
>As a startup, you'll have **plenty of time** before you need to scale and you may never need to scale at all if your idea doesn't work.

So what are the tasks you can **avoid automating**? Monthly billing reminder emails?
Instead of spending the time upfront building a system to do it, can a **human being do this manually for now* for $6/hour (a VA) and then you automate once it's costing you more because you've scaled?

**When is a VA helpful?**
1. _When proving your product_: It might take a week to code up the automation of a task, but it could instead take you 1-2 hours of time to write out the process and have a VA carry that piece out manually for now whilst you're proving your product works. Outsourcing also provides a written process for the task that you might not otherwise have.
You want to iterate and **learn**. Get the _feature out the door to your customers_ - by doing this through a VA you can save 50-80% of development time - and then **automate it _if your customers decide to use it_!**
2. _After product launch_:
>Customers make it necessary to put processes in place for marketing, sales, support and back-end administrative tasks.
Anything that can be written as a process can be outsourced - otherwise it's getting in the way of things that are truly productive for your business.

_Examples of what can be automated:_
- Level 1 email support & sales questions
- Manning live chat windows on website
- Directory submissions
- Running month end reports
- Minor HTML tweaks
- Keyword research
- Link building
- Following up on cancelled subscriptions (or baskets that didn't check out, with a discount offer)

**Choosing a VA**
Getting them to send you examples of written pieces is often useless as these can be heavily edited.
* Exchange 3-5 emails with them & ask them 2-3 basic interview questions
	* Get a feel for ther English and how well you understand each other
* Do this with 3-5 VAs at the same time to speed up the process

**When delegating:**
* Back _everything_ up first
* Use screenshots or screencasts ([Jing Project](http://www.jingproject.com) recommended for screencasts)
* Timebox: work for 1 hour then update me on progress - if it's taking them longer than you think it should, _ask how you can help_.
