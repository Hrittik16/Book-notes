#Chapter 1 - The Chasm Between Develop & Entrepreneur

Seeking *venture capital creates 2 kinds of problems*:
1. Massive investment of time and focus away from things like your product and staying in business
2. Eliminates the option of 'modest succes' by forcing you to pursue much bigger markets immediately to get a good return on investment

* No venture capital equals organic growth through re-investment of profits and therefore offers a lower risk.

* *Niche markets are critical* - they're too small for large competitors and always underserved.

#####Product last, marketing first.
* Your product has to be good but you need to *know if people want it _before_ you build it*.
* *Goals* should be written down and publically communicated and you should be accountable to someone - you accomplish significantly more by writing a weekly email with your progress to a friend than you would without this.
	* This is crucial to keep you motivated during difficult times

#####Good short-term goal suggestion: "Strive to build a startup that generates Â£500 a month in profit."

* Do remember there is a burden of *support* required once you release a product

_Most common roadblocks:_

1. _*No market:*_ product-first approaches only occasionally works (rarely) - test the _validity of your market *first*_.

2. _*Fear:*_ The fear that "stands between you and your goal is something 99.9% of people will never overcome" and it's a good indicator your *going to grow as a person if you get through it*.

3. _*Lack of goals:*_ Having goals makes decisions more clear cut, without them you're flying blind. Have and *write them down* (long term AND short term).

4. _*Inconsistency:*_ Be wary of time wasting masquarading as productivity - instead of looking for 50 blogs to market to, could you maybe look for 10 with the same effect? Or spend half that time writing out a brief for your virtual assistant (VA) to do it? *Limit* your information consumption, make sure what you're doing for that hour is getting you 1 hour closer to launch.

5. _*Believing you have to do everything yourself:*_ Linked to the above - some things are fun even, but you can outsource them a to VAor other professional to save time -> start with outsourcing non-critical tasks until you're comfortable with contractors.

#####Dollarize your time, so that there's no doubt whether something is worth outsourcing or not.

*How?*
1. Base it on freelance rates
2. Base it on salary & benefits

* _Step 1:_ realise your time is worth $x /hour
* _Step 2:_ actually generate $x /hour
* _Step 3:_ figure out how to make it be worth more!

*$100 an hour is a good long-term goal.* If you're only making $25/hour you're doing something wrong.
* You won't be earning $50/hour when you start but should aim to hit that figure _within 6 months of launching_

#####Ask yourself: "At this very moment, am I making progress towards crossing off a to-do or am I relaxing & re-energising?"
* Both are ok, but don't waste time on un-enjoyable activities. _If you're at the movies and you're finding it boring, walk out._
* *Never find yourself killing time* - every non-work, non-leisure minute spent is a money waster, so carry a notebook with you everywhere.
* Remember that _information consumption_ is only ever good when it produces something so *always take notes* and make sure you take action on them!
* Being a good developer is not enough: in Michael Gerber's 'E-myth Revisited' there are 3 archetypes of running a business:
	* _Entrepreneur:_ visionary, long term goals
	* _Manager:_ ROI and productivity
	* _Technician:_ gets work done

> Market comes 1st, marketing 2nd, aesthetics 3rd and functionality a distant 4th.

#Chapter 2

The key is that *people must be willing to pay for your product* - market first.

Always _go for a niche market_ because:
* It narrows focus of your product
* Niche advertising is more cost effective
* Less competition
* Higher profit margines because you're solving a _very specific_ problem
* Niche markets are not used to good marketing so you'll have an advantage
* Easier to be trusted - small enough niches mean you'll see each other around more

*Create a list* of hobbies/interests and put names of people you know against each one - these are your _'warm niches'_.

*Find your niche*:
1. Examine your hobbies, interests and work
2. Scan through a list of occupations and check if you have experience or contacts with them

> Creating demand is very, very expensive whereas filling demand is, by comparison, cheap.

* *Is there a magazine for your market?* Then it's probably large enough to have enough customers and if you can advertise for less than $5k, you can probably reach them
* Remember that *being on the front page of Digg or Buzzfeed* is inconsequential if this isn't your market and it won't convert into sales

*Go for vertical markets* over horizontal ones:
* People in verticals have similar behaviours
* They 'hang out' together and talk to one another
* They have similar needs
