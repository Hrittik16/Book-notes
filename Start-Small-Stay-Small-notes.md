#Chapter 1 - The Chasm Between Develop & Entrepreneur

Seeking *venture capital creates 2 kinds of problems*:
1. Massive investment of time and focus away from things like your product and staying in business
2. Eliminates the option of 'modest succes' by forcing you to pursue much bigger markets immediately to get a good return on investment

No venture capital equals organic growth through re-investment of profits and therefore offers a lower risk.

*Niche markets are critical* - they're too small for large competitors and always underserved.

###Product last, marketing first.
Your product has to be good but you need to know if people want it *before* you build it.
