#Chapter 1 - The Chasm Between Develop & Entrepreneur

Seeking *venture capital creates 2 kinds of problems*:
1. Massive investment of time and focus away from things like your product and staying in business
2. Eliminates the option of 'modest succes' by forcing you to pursue much bigger markets immediately to get a good return on investment

* No venture capital equals organic growth through re-investment of profits and therefore offers a lower risk.

* *Niche markets are critical* - they're too small for large competitors and always underserved.

####Product last, marketing first.
* Your product has to be good but you need to *know if people want it _before_ you build it*.
* *Goals* should be written down and publically communicated and you should be accountable to someone - you accomplish significantly more by writing a weekly email with your progress to a friend than you would without this.
	* This is crucial to keep you motivated during difficult times

####Good short-term goal suggestion: "Strive to build a startup that generates Â£500 a month in profit."

* Do remember there is a burden of *support* required once you release a product

_Most common roadblocks:_
1. _*No market:*_ product-first approaches only occasionally works (rarely) - test the _validity of your market *first*_.
2. _*Fear:*_ The fear that "stands between you and your goal is something 99.9% of people will never overcome" and it's a good indicator your *going to grow as a person if you get through it*.
3. _*Lack of goals:*_ Having goals makes decisions more clear cut, without them you're flying blind. Have and *write them down* (long term AND short term).
4. _*Inconsistency:*_ Be wary of time wasting masquarading as productivity - instead of looking for 50 blogs to market to, could you maybe look for 10 with the same effect? Or spend half that time writing out a brief for your virtual assistant (VA) to do it? *Limit* your information consumption, make sure what you're doing for that hour is getting you 1 hour closer to launch.
5. _*Beliveing you have to do everything yourself:*_ Linked to the above - some things are fun even, but you can outsource them a to VAor other professional to save time -> start with outsourcing non-critical tasks until you're comfortable with contractors.
