> Startups are unpredictable. We will have failures and we will screw it up several times before we get it right.

The fundamental difference between a 'startup' and a 'company' is that **in a startup, the customers and product features are _unknown_.**
The start-ups only role is to run a series of experiments
based on the founder's vision, to iterate and understand what these are.
It is **constantly in search mode** until the customer and product features are known.

A startup solves for ***problem/solution fit*** (product/market fit):  
Have we found a problem people want solved, does our solution solve it in a compelling enough way that they'll part with their cash?

The founder's job is to "**translate their vision and hypotheses into facts**."

## Overviews of the 4 key steps

### 1. Customer Discovery
+ Taking the _founder's vision_ as the **initial product specification** and finding customers and a market for that vision
+ **_Not_ about collecting lists of desired features** from potential customers or running focus groups
+ **Turns the vision into a set of hypotheses and experiments to test those hypotheses**
+ **Turns assumptions into known facts**
+ Develop your product **for the _few_, not _all_ the customers**
  + On the first day, there's no input from customers to develop spec

> In a startup, the first product is not designed to satisfy a mainstream customer.

+ Two get-out-of-the-building portions:
  + Test the need to solve the problem
  + Test the product solves the problem well enough to have paying customers (_obtaining_ paying customers is part of [Customer Validation](#2.-customer-validation))

> For web products, customer discovery begins when the first "low-fidelity" version of the app is up and running. - p.26

+ A pivot or iterations happen as a result of _learning_ from customer feedback, **not as a result of _failure_**
+ This stage means you spend as little cash as possible on things that _don't_ work (agile vs waterfall)
+ A founder is "**free to ignore** all of customer discovery" (particularly for a new market) as long as they can _articulate why_

+ A reminder: **don't give away or heavily discount** your post-MVP/alpha product at this stage - you want to test your assumptions and _crucially_ find your 'earlyvangelists' who are willing to pay for it
  + "Earlyvangelists are willing or eager accelerators of your early growth"


### 2. Customer Validation
+ Proves that the product _also_ has a **repeatable, scalable, business model** that is required for the organisation to be profitable
  + Tests customers exist, are genuinely willing to pay for the solution and validates key features
+ This is the "hi-fidelity" MVP
+ **Key to validation: paying customers**
+ When the sales and profitable business model have been validated, a startup achieves "escape velocity" and **can start to scale**
+ Often the only team that exists until the _end of the customer validation phase_ is the product development team (no sales, marketing, etc)

> Completing these first two steps (discovery and validation) verifies the product's core features, the market's existence, locates customers, tests the product's perceived value and demand, identifies who will buy the product, establishes pricing and channel strategies and checks out the proposed sales cycle process.


### 3. Customer Creation
+ This is the ramp-up stage where money is spent to acquire new customers (though not more than the customers will bring in!)
+ Example of IMVU in the book ran numerous **low cost market segmentation experiments** before settling on _which ones to spend money on_


### 4. Company Building
+ A scaleable, repeatable business model with known customers has been found and the organisation is **no longer a startup** and is now in _execution mode_ (not search mode)
  + Repeatable = not just coming from the founders' network of friends
  + Scaleable = adding a marketing dollar adds _more_ than you invested to the company
+ To get to this stage, you need to answer the question **have we learned enough to go out and sell?**
+ Here, if the **founder sees the company is expanding beyond their skillset**, it's the right time to hire a seasoned CEO to manage the execution

## Customer Development Manifesto
These are word for word as in this excellent book, starting on p. 31, with what I personally found to be the most important points in brackets next to them.

1. There are no facts in the building, so get outside.
(The founder _must_ gather **firsthand experience** of every part of the business model)
+ Pair customer development with agile development.
+ **Failure is an integral part of search**.
(Remember you're _searching_ not _executing_ and therefore running hundreds of pass/fail tests, don't take them personally)
+ Make continuous iterations and pivots.
(Don't hesitate, make the changes based on your customer discovery and validation learnings)
+ No business plan survives first contact with customers, so use a **business model canvas**.
(Contains all hypotheses, with a **new one created at _every_ iteration or pivot**)
+ **Design experiments** (understand how you want to test and what you want to learn) and test to validate your hypotheses.
(Answer "what insight do I need to move forward and what's the simplest test to get it" - **no need for this to be code**, just mockups; you're looking for strong validation in customer development, e.g 50% of people want it even if it's buggy)
+ Agree on a market type, it changes everything.
(e.g. new market, existing market or resegmentation of an existing market; **startups must commit to _one_**, consequences of it being incorrect are _severe_ at customer creation)
+ Startup metrics differ form those in existing companies.
(Tracks progress of _testing the hypotheses_ and nothing else)
+ Fast decision making, cycle time, speed and tempo.
(_Reversible_ decisions should be made before the end of the meeting, _irreversible_ ones can take a little longer need to be quick. **"Perfect decision making is unimportant and impossible"**)
+ It's all about passion.
(Successful founders' brains are "wired for chaos, uncertainty and blinding speed")
+ Startup job titles are very different from a large company's.
(In the beginning everyone is the Customer Development team)
+ Preserve all cash until needed. Then spend.
(When you get to Company Building stage)
+ Communicate and Share Learning.
(In near-real time via a blog, CRM or product management tool)
+ Customer development success begins with buy-in.
(**_Everyone_ on team must accept hypothesis-led, search mode nature of Customer Development**, no matter what their background)

## Customer Discovery
This section _builds_ on the [overview above](#overviews) so if you haven't read that yet, go read if first! :eyeglasses: :book:

The concept here is to _understand if there's problem/solution fit by testing hypotheses using your MVP_, keeping track of your progress with a Business Model Canvas, then finding your _earlyvangelists_ who are willing to pay for the early version.

#### Steps (p.67)
1. Transform founder's vision into 9 parts of the Business Model Canvas, with a **page of the tests you'll run for each hypothesis**.
+ Use your lo-fi prototype to test your hypotheses and _turn these into facts_.
+ Use your MVP to test your _solution_
  + The goal isn't to _sell_ but to **see users engage and interact repeatedly or lengthily** with the product and spread the word!
  + You want customers to ask "when can I get it?"
+ Determine whether you've learnt enough to go searching for earlyvangelists to _sell_ to

> A startup is builds its product for a small group of initial customers rather than devising a generic mainstream spec

Start by developing an MVP so that customers found by the Customer Development team have something to feedback against.
**In the beginning there is no customer input so this is driven by the vision and experience of the founders.**

The **goal of your MVP** is not to start gathering a long list of features but the test _whether you **understood the problem** well enough_.
  + _If_ no customers can be found for the initial MVP, start to bring in some of the additional feature requests - keep a level head about this, it should be the **exception, not the rule**
  + The whole process is accelerated for web (see p. 62)

### Earlyvangelists, 'The most important customers of all'
'Earlyvangelists' _understand_ they have a problem and have cobbled together an _interim solution_ already.
+ They are at the top of the 'pain scale'
+ They are willing to give you feedback often
+ They're keen to spread the word

> Most users want finished products but earlyvangelists are the perfect target for the MVP. Tailor the initial release to satisfy their needs.

### Business Model Canvas
+ Create one to hold your starting hypotheses
+ Each one is a single moment in time
+ Customer Development team should use this as a 'scorecard' and **create a new one for each iteration and pivot**, highlighting the changes from the previous week/iteration

### Phase 1
Made up of the hypotheses in the business model canvas + the market size hypothesis (only one not in the BMC).

#### Market Size hypothesis
Estimate these three:
+ **Total Addressable Market (TAM)** - e.g. total no. of smartphone users in the world
+ **Served Available Market (SAM)** - total no. I can reach through my sales channel (e.g. Apple app store)
+ **Target Market** - people who are likely to buy *my* application

A lot of web startups care mostly about the number of eyeballs they can get
but if this is the business model (audience first, moentise later)
then the key is to understand who will _pay_ for that audience.

_Tip:_ Use **Google tools** to determine keywords and understand how many people are searching for them.

Apparently more on this topic in Customer Discovery Phase 2, p218.

#### Value Proposition hypothesis

Write a series of briefs on:
+ **Product vision**
  + What you want your successful company to become (often more than one product)
  + Earlyvangelists are only spending money on a buggy initial version **because they believe in the total vision** for the product
  + _Excellent_ set of questions to be answered and example for **bullet point product vision** on p. 76
  + Also specifies **MVP and follow-on product dates** 18 months to 3 years into the future (first pass, not set in stone
+ **Product features and benefits**
  + One page with top 10ish features of the complete product vision
  + Product _benefits_ are how the product features solve a problem through the customer's eyes, a user story
    + To do this, describe the problem, describe what frustrations the
    problem is causing - how much lost revenue, time, level of frustration, slow speed, etc - and how the product will solve it
+ **MVP**
  + "(...) smallest possible group of features that will work as a stand-alone product while still solving at least the "core" problem and demonstrating the product's value"
  + Define what needs to be learned and ask 'what is the smallest or least complicated problem the customer will pay us to solve?'
  + Lo-fidelity MVPs test if you've correctly _identified a problem people care about_
  + Hi-fidelity MVP (Phase 3) tests whether the product _solves_ the problem (in Customer Validation, this should look and act much like a finished product)
  


> The goal of Customer Development is _not_ to collect features from customers [this is how you end up with 10 new features that will only get you an additional 5 customers], it's to **understand what not to ship**.




## Customer Development


> Minimize the number of features _not used_ by getting an MVP into customers' hands asap.

> **No new features until you've exhausted the search for a business model [with the current set]**.
