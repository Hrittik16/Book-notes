> Startups are unpredictable. We will have failures and we will screw it up several times before we get it right.

The fundamental difference between a 'startup' and a 'company' is that **in a startup, the customers and product features are _unknown_.**
The start-ups only role is to run a series of experiments
based on the founder's vision, to iterate and understand what these are.
It is **constantly in search mode**.

The founder's job is to "**translate their vision and hypotheses into facts**."

## Customer Discovery

### Overview
+ Taking the _founder's vision_ as the **initial product specification** and finding customers and a market for that vision
+ **_Not_ about collecting lists of desired features** from potential customers or running focus groups
+ **Turns the vision into a set of hypotheses and experiments to test those hypotheses**
+ Two get-out-of-the-building portions:
  + Test the need to solve the problem
  + Test the product solves the problem well enough to have paying customers (_obtaining_ paying customers is part of [Customer Validation](#customer-validation))

> For web products, customer discovery begins when the first "low-fidelity" version of the app is up and running. - p.26

+ A pivot happens as a result of _learning_ from customer feedback, **not as a result of _failure_**
+ A founder is "**free to ignore** all of customer discovery" (particularly for a new market) as long as they can _articulate why_

+ Where to start:
  + Minimal google adwords marketing spend
  + Detailed analytics monitoring

## Customer Validation

### Overview
+ Proves that the product _also_ has a **repeatable, scalable, business model** that is required for the organisation to be profitable
  + Tests customers exist, are genuinely willing to pay for the solution and validates key features
+ This is the "hi-fidelity" MVP
+ **Key to validation: paying customers**
+ When the sales and profitable business model have been validated, a startup achieves "escape velocity" and **can start to scale**
+ Often the only team that exists until the _end of the customer validation phase_ is the product development team (no sales, marketing, etc)

> Completing these first two steps (discovery and validation) verifies the product's core features, the market's existence, locates customers, tests the product's perceived value and demand, identifies who will buy the product, establishes pricing and channel strategies and checks out the proposed sales cycle process.

## Customer Creation

### Overview
+ This is the ramp-up stage where money is spent to acquire new customers (though not more than the customers will bring in!)
+ Example of IMVU in the book ran numerous **low cost market segmentation experiments** before settling on _which ones to spend money on_

## Company Building

### Overview
+ A scaleable, repeatable business model with known customers has been found and the organisation is **no longer a startup** and is now in _execution mode_ (not search mode)
  + Repeatable = not just coming from the founders' network of friends
  + Scaleable = adding a marketing dollar adds _more_ than you invested to the company
+ Here, if the **founder sees the company is expanding beyond their skillset**, it's the right time to hire a seasoned CEO to manage the execution

## Customer Development Manifesto
These are word for word as in this excellent book, starting on p. 31, with what I personally found to be the most important points in brackets next to them.

1. There are no facts in the building, so get outside.
(The founder _must_ gather **firsthand experience** of every part of the business model)
+ Pair customer development with agile development.
+ **Failure is an integral part of search**.
(Remember you're _searching_ not _executing_ and therefore running hundreds of pass/fail tests, don't take them personally)
+ Make continuous iterations and pivots.
(Don't hesitate, make the changes based on your customer discovery and validation learnings)
+ No business plan survives first contact with customers, so use a **business model canvas**.
(Contains all hypotheses, with a **new one created at _every_ iteration or pivot**)
+ **Design experiments** (understand how you want to test and what you want to learn) and test to validate your hypotheses.
(Answer "what insight do I need to move forward and what's the simplest test to get it" - **no need for this to be code**, just mockups; you're looking for strong validation in customer development, e.g 50% of people want it even if it's buggy)
+ Agree on a market type, it changes everything.
(e.g. new market, existing market or resegmentation of an existing market; **startups must commit to _one_**, consequences of it being incorrect are _severe_ at customer creation)
+ Startup metrics differ form those in existing companies.
(Tracks progress of _testing the hypotheses_ and nothing else)
+ Fast decision making, cycle time, speed and tempo.
(_Reversible_ decisions should be made before the end of the meeting, _irreversible_ ones can take a little longer need to be quick. **"Perfect decision making is unimportant and impossible"**)
+ It's all about passion.
(Successful founders' brains are "wired for chaos, uncertainty and blinding speed")
+ Startup job titles are very different from a large company's.
(In the beginning everyone is the Customer Development team)
+ Preserve all cash until needed. Then spend.
(When you get to Company Building stage)
+ Communicate and Share Learning.
(In near-real time via a blog, CRM or product management tool)
+ Customer development success begins with buy-in.
(**_Everyone_ on team must accept hypothesis-led, search mode nature of Customer Development**, no matter what their background)
