These notes are very much just the things I jotted down whilst I was going through this and certainly do not form the complete knowledge contained therein. Lots of interesting stuff though!

#Part 1 - Why are we here?
> This book is about the user's perspective: it's about making things _feel_ simple to use

* When trying to simplify, you need to understand how your change will affect each of the elements of how a company functions
  * For example, (number of cars sold) x (price of car) - (cost of overhead) = profit
* Plot out how important a change is vs how ease that change is to implement (then of course, go for the ones that are most important and most practical)

#Part 2 - Setting a vision
>A vision gives you a way of judging whether you're keeping things simple

* Two types:
  * **One-line description** that usually answers the question "What is this for?" and is good for small tasks like a single page on a website
  * **Description of the user experience** you're looking to create - what the user's world looks like and how what your designing fits into it - and is good for large tasks like whole apps
* Make sure you **visit the environment where people will use your product** so you can gain a unique understanding of the challenges they genuinely face on a day-to-day business at the time they come to use it
  * A lot of the time, both in the office and at home this boils down to _constant interruptions, divided attention_ and _needing to do things quickly because of other priorities_ (like having to perform a task whilst the kids are watching a 20 minute cartoon)
