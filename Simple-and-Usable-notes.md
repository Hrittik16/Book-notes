These notes are very much just the things I jotted down whilst I was going through this and certainly do not form the complete knowledge contained therein. Lots of interesting stuff though!

#Part 1 - Why are we here?
> This book is about the user's perspective: it's about making things _feel_ simple to use

* When trying to simplify, you need to understand how your change will affect each of the elements of how a company functions
  * For example, (number of cars sold) x (price of car) - (cost of overhead) = profit
* Plot out how important a change is vs how ease that change is to implement (then of course, go for the ones that are most important and most practical)

#Part 2 - Setting a vision
>A vision gives you a way of judging whether you're keeping things simple

Don't rush into design, find your vision first. (Note from [Ines](http://www.twitter.com/iteles): Simon Sinek's ['Start with Why'](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Start-With-Why-Leaders-Everyone/dp/0241958229) is an excellent book on this topic)

Two types of vision:
* **One-line description** that usually answers the question "What is this for?" and is good for small tasks like a single page on a website
  * Say it _out loud_ to someone - if they get it straight away, then it's clear enough
  * Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone as 'a widescreen iPod... a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough Internet communications device'
* [**Description of the user experience**](#userexperience) you're looking to create - what the user's world looks like and how what your designing fits into it - and is good for large tasks like whole apps
  * Make sure you **visit the environment where people will use your product** so you can gain a unique understanding of the challenges they genuinely face on a day-to-day business at the time they come to use it
    * A lot of the time, both in the office and at home this boils down to _constant interruptions, divided attention_ and _needing to do things quickly because of other priorities_ (like having to perform a task whilst the kids are watching a 20 minute cartoon)

There are 3 types of users:
* **Experts** who are big into technology and customising everything for their own needs - you shouldn't make design decisions based on their opinions as they have very different (& often much more complex) needs to the majority of your users
* **Willing adopters**
* **Mainstreamers** who are the _vast majority_ of people <- **these are the people you design for**
>Experiences that feel simple are designed for the mainstreamers

**What mainstreamers want:**
* Getting their task done _now_, not interested in long learning curves or going through all the settings to customise the app (for example) to their requirements
* Ease of control (not precision), without an overwhelming number of options
* Reliable results, even if they're not perfect
* Examples and stories
>Simple user experiences need to work for a novice, or a mainstreamer **who's under pressure**.
(so don't assume you can teach them a lot of stuff or that instruction will make much difference).

People are driven by **emotional needs** - you need to understand the reason people need your software.
* For the [Things app](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for example, this is "to be able to caputre a thousand items and yet not feel overwhelmed when they looked at the list"
* The key emotional need is for a user to **feel they're in control**
  * Your product needs to _respond in a predictable way_
  * It can be that your product is helping someone be more in control of something in their lives (it's not only about them having control over the app)
  * Begin with what you think the user's need is and then keep asking **"So what?"** until you eventually get to the _emotional_ need of that user and therefore have a deeper understanding of what you're trying to solve

<a name="userexperience"/>
Describing the **user experience** in your vision:
* It's important to describe every step of what the user does from the moment they start using your product to when they stop so that you can ensure your design doesn't miss out any important steps
  * Try to use the user's language as well - they aren't 'social networking', they're 'sharing photos with friends'
* A **story** is a fantastic way to describe your vision of the user experience as it helps you and the readers _understand what's important and why_
  * Stories are also easy to remember and to re-tell!
  * You want your story to be concise but add in details for realism and memorability - your protagonist isn't 'positive', say that she smiles and says a cheery good morning as she walks past her coworker

An interesting example of a user experience story from p.38 of the book:
>You're on a city street when you hear a commotion: Paris Hilton is walking toward you. You pull your Flip camera out of your pocket and hand it to a stranger, asking her to video you with Paris in the background. Then you hurry to a nearby friend's house where you use her computer to share your movie online, without any instructions.

* Aiming for extreme targets for your products - even ones that aren't entirely possible, like 'responds instantly' and '_anyone_ can use it' - keeps you **facing in the right direction** and striving for more improved results
* Look back over the facts and knowledge you've gathered about your users when researching your story and figure out what things have the most impact on your users' behaviour - are you sure you're not failing them on these things (for example, if your users value design above most other priorities, is your design well executed)?

####**Share your vision widely**. If you do, the right decisions will be made for your product even if you're not there, because everyone will know what drives them.

#Part 3 - Four strategies for simplicity
Good tip: **when interviewing someone for a job as a designer**, ask them to take something unnecessarily complicated and _simplify it_.

Each of these will be discussed in detail in the following chapters:
* [**Remove**](#part4) unnecessary features
* [**Organize**](#part5) in a way that makes more sense than the current organization (grouping, for example)
* [**Hide**](#part6) all but the most important or frequently used features
* [**Displace**](#part7) by moving the onus of features to another device (even if that 'device' is the user)

<a name="part4"/>
#Part 4 - Remove
>According to a 2002 study by Standish Group, 64 percent of software features are "never or rarely used"
* This strategy is about **removing distractions** so your users can **focus on your project** or call to action
* Don't cut features just because they're too difficult to build
* _Do_ cut features that are poorly implemented - remember that if it's broken, it'll probably get fixed, but if it's just shoddy, it'll probably be around for a _very_ long time
* Don't ask "shall we get rid of it?", ask **"Why should we keep it?"**
* Actually speak to your users to see what they will or won't do with your software, don't sit around thinking about 'what if the user wants to...?'
* If solving a problem leads to a particularly complex process feature-wise, "is there another way to solve the problem?"
* Once a customer _has_ a product, their preferences change from 'having more features' to 'being more usable' - so in the long run, **usability is king**, more so than a feature list
* Focus on **absolutely delighting your users with core tasks** and aim to please on secondary tasks
* Judge your product on how well it suits your users' needs (not its feature list)
  * To do this, always list your users' needs _and prioritize them_
* "Lighten the load" on your users by removing unnecessary content and distractions so they can **focus** on the important things
  * Options and preferences are usually goo things to remove from your main page or altogether
* Check error logs regularly for common errors, then remove these to simplify your users' experience
* Limit visual clutter by using thin lines, white space and limiting the variation in sizes of elements
* Remove unneccessary instructions ('fill in this form and click submit to send it to us') and introductions ('Welcome to my website, I hope you like it')
* Simplify text and boil it down to the main content
* Beware of **removing too many options**, people still need to feel they have a level of control over their experience
  * The example given in the book is the Apple Store in Tokyo where the elevators have no buttons, it just stops at every floor

#Part 5 - Organize
* For a simple design, it's important to **emphasize just one or two important things** so your user is never in any doubt as to where to start
*
