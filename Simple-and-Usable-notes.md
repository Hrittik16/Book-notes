#Part 1 - Why are we here?
> This book is about the user's perspective: it's about making things _feel_ simple to use

* When trying to simplify, you need to understand how your change will affect each of the elements of how a company functions
  * For example, (number of cars sold) x (price of car) - (cost of overhead) = profit
* Plot out how important a change is vs how ease that change is to implement (then of course, go for the ones that are most important and most practical)

#Part 2 - Setting a vision
>A vision gives you a way of judging whether you're keeping things simple

Don't rush into design, find your vision first. (Note from [Ines](http://www.twitter.com/iteles): Simon Sinek's ['Start with Why'](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Start-With-Why-Leaders-Everyone/dp/0241958229) is an excellent book on this topic)

Two types of vision:
* **One-line description** that usually answers the question "What is this for?" and is good for small tasks like a single page on a website
  * Say it _out loud_ to someone - if they get it straight away, then it's clear enough
  * Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone as 'a widescreen iPod... a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough Internet communications device'
* [**Description of the user experience**](#userexperience) you're looking to create - what the user's world looks like and how what your designing fits into it - and is good for large tasks like whole apps
  * Make sure you **visit the environment where people will use your product** so you can gain a unique understanding of the challenges they genuinely face on a day-to-day business at the time they come to use it
    * A lot of the time, both in the office and at home this boils down to _constant interruptions, divided attention_ and _needing to do things quickly because of other priorities_ (like having to perform a task whilst the kids are watching a 20 minute cartoon)

There are 3 types of users:
* **Experts** who are big into technology and customising everything for their own needs - you shouldn't make design decisions based on their opinions as they have very different (& often much more complex) needs to the majority of your users
* **Willing adopters**
* **Mainstreamers** who are the _vast majority_ of people <- **these are the people you design for**
>Experiences that feel simple are designed for the mainstreamers

**What mainstreamers want:**
* Getting their task done _now_, not interested in long learning curves or going through all the settings to customise the app (for example) to their requirements
* Ease of control (not precision), without an overwhelming number of options
* Reliable results, even if they're not perfect
* Examples and stories
>Simple user experiences need to work for a novice, or a mainstreamer **who's under pressure**.
(so don't assume you can teach them a lot of stuff or that instruction will make much difference).

People are driven by **emotional needs** - you need to understand the reason people need your software.
* For the [Things app](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for example, this is "to be able to caputre a thousand items and yet not feel overwhelmed when they looked at the list"
* The key emotional need is for a user to **feel they're in control**
  * Your product needs to _respond in a predictable way_
  * It can be that your product is helping someone be more in control of something in their lives (it's not only about them having control over the app)
  * Begin with what you think the user's need is and then keep asking **"So what?"** until you eventually get to the _emotional_ need of that user and therefore have a deeper understanding of what you're trying to solve

<a name="userexperience"/>
Describing the **user experience** in your vision:
* It's important to describe every step of what the user does from the moment they start using your product to when they stop so that you can ensure your design doesn't miss out any important steps
  * Try to use the user's language as well - they aren't 'social networking', they're 'sharing photos with friends'
* A **story** is a fantastic way to describe your vision of the user experience as it helps you and the readers _understand what's important and why_
  * Stories are also easy to remember and to re-tell!
  * You want your story to be concise but add in details for realism and memorability - your protagonist isn't 'positive', say that she smiles and says a cheery good morning as she walks past her coworker

An interesting example of a user experience story from p.38 of the book:
>You're on a city street when you hear a commotion: Paris Hilton is walking toward you. You pull your Flip camera out of your pocket and hand it to a stranger, asking her to video you with Paris in the background. Then you hurry to a nearby friend's house where you use her computer to share your movie online, without any instructions.

* Aiming for extreme targets for your products - even ones that aren't entirely possible, like 'responds instantly' and '_anyone_ can use it' - keeps you **facing in the right direction** and striving for more improved results
* Look back over the facts and knowledge you've gathered about your users when researching your story and figure out what things have the most impact on your users' behaviour - are you sure you're not failing them on these things (for example, if your users value design above most other priorities, is your design well executed)?

####**Share your vision widely**. If you do, the right decisions will be made for your product even if you're not there, because everyone will know what drives them.

#Part 3 - Four strategies for simplicity
Good tip: **when interviewing someone for a job as a designer**, ask them to take something unnecessarily complicated and _simplify it_.

Each of these will be discussed in detail in the following chapters:
* [**Remove**](#part4) unnecessary features
* [**Organize**](#part5) in a way that makes more sense than the current organization (grouping, for example)
* [**Hide**](#part6) all but the most important or frequently used features
* [**Displace**](#part7) by moving the onus of features to another device (even if that 'device' is the user)

<a name="part4"/>
#Part 4 - Remove
>According to a 2002 study by Standish Group, 64 percent of software features are "never or rarely used"

* This strategy is about **removing distractions** so your users can **focus on your project** or call to action
* Don't cut features just because they're too difficult to build
* _Do_ cut features that are poorly implemented - remember that if it's broken, it'll probably get fixed, but if it's just shoddy, it'll probably be around for a _very_ long time
* Don't ask "shall we get rid of it?", ask **"Why should we keep it?"**
* Actually speak to your users to see what they will or won't do with your software, don't sit around thinking about 'what if the user wants to...?'
* If solving a problem leads to a particularly complex process feature-wise, "is there another way to solve the problem?"
* Once a customer _has_ a product, their preferences change from 'having more features' to 'being more usable' - so in the long run, **usability is king**, more so than a feature list
* Focus on **absolutely delighting your users with core tasks** and aim to please on secondary tasks
* Judge your product on how well it suits your users' needs (not its feature list)
  * To do this, always list your users' needs _and prioritize them_
* "Lighten the load" on your users by removing unnecessary content and distractions so they can **focus** on the important things
  * Options and preferences are usually goo things to remove from your main page or altogether
* Check error logs regularly for common errors, then remove these to simplify your users' experience
* Limit visual clutter by using thin lines, white space and limiting the variation in sizes of elements
* Remove unneccessary instructions ('fill in this form and click submit to send it to us') and introductions ('Welcome to my website, I hope you like it')
* Simplify text and boil it down to the main content
* Beware of **removing too many options**, people still need to feel they have a level of control over their experience
  * The example given in the book is the Apple Store in Tokyo where the elevators have no buttons, it just stops at every floor

<a name="part5"/>
#Part 5 - Organize
* For a simple design, it's important to **emphasize just one or two important things** so your user is never in any doubt as to where to start
* If you have _a lot_ of features on items, **chunk them** into smaller groups of item (like Microsoft Word grouping functionality into 9 menu items for example)
  * Although research suggests the mind can only hold up to 4 items, but most people apply chunking into **groups of 7 items**
* **Organize your site based on your user's behaviour**
  * If there is one main task where users are going to spend the majority of their time (shopping on a grocery site for example), that should be _the most prominent part_ of your site
  * Think about what your users are going to want to do on your site and _organize it into those sections_
  * People usually **expect things in a particular sequence** so it's very frustrating when that sequence is broken (usually by a registration process)
* Use **labels that make sense to your audience** - make sure they have 'hard edges' and aren't fuzzy
  * _Ask a handful of users to organize the items into categories_ & if they all have different answers, you're in trouble!
* Try to organize by category as **alphabetising is problematic** as users often don't know the exact word to look for
* Users usually **prefer browsing via links to searching** and will only really search for items when the links don't look like they'll get them to where they want to be
* **Setting events on a timeline** can often be powerful, but works best when _events are of a similar duration_ (so users don't have to keep zooming in and out to get the details) and only for situations where you don't end up with some super busy areas and lots of dead space around that
* **Use grids**: lining items up makes things look neater and draws a user's eyes across a screen as items out of line are distracting (good example of a redesign of a form using a grid on p.127)
  * If you want it to feel less regimented, have some elements straddle several columns of the grid or pick an uneven (assymetric) number of columns
* Make **important things big** even if that means making them out of scale (like making a golf ball the same size as a football on your screen) - you don't want non-important things stealing the attention away from the important ones just because they are bigger
* Put **similar things** close together - this may sound simple but it _reduces the need for lots of unnecessary extra video cues like colour coding_
* Tip: on **touch screens, place the main navigation at the bottom**, this way users can touch it _without covering the screen_ with their hand
* **Perceptual layering** is used on London tube maps, where colours (for example) are used to create the illusion of layers which allow the user to focus on just one 'layer' at a time
  * Use coloured tint to group related content
  * Use colours to tie together elements across a webpage like the 'buy' button and 'checkout' button
  * For important categories, "use bright saturated colours to make them pop off the page"
  * For categories of equal importance, make them the same brightness and size, but vary the colour
  * Use as few layers as possible and _always squint at your page_ to double check your layers are clear
* **Colour coding works best when** you have users who will have the time or will reuse your product enough to _learn your code_, or have already learnt it from somewhere else (like the traffic light system)
* Your users don't always follow the path you set through your product, so walk through it a few times and watch other people doing the same
  * **Squint at the page** to make sure the right things pop out at you at every stage

<a name="part6"/>
#Part 6 - Hide
> You must carefully choose what to hide so as not to inconvenience the user

* Hide information that is **necessary but used infrequently** such as account details and settings (usually at the edge of an application)
* Allowing the user to customise everything in the interface is often more laziness on the part of the designer than anything else, only do it if it is very aligned with your product's mission
  * And automatic customisation is often a _terrible_ idea because users can't learn where things are if they keep changing and it's very frustrating
* Hide options that are really only for the experts who use your products
  * Example: the save menu in Word opens with the simpler _mainstream_ options but allows users to un-hide a number of expert options - and then saves the preferences for next time
* **Staged disclosure** reveals more features as the user gets deeper into the product
  * Works well where an increase in complexity is expected
  * _Set the scene_ and always let your users know where they are in your product ("Welcome to the secure checkout")
  * _Tell a story_ with the flow of your screens - users expect the interaction with your product to unfold like a story, the order of things (in a checkout process where they have to choose from a couple of different options for example) has to make sense to them
    - User test this!
  * Each chunk of information you reveal should be _complete and self contained_
  * Speak the user's language
* If you hide features, you have to **choose an appropriate label for them**
  * It's a good idea to choose a label that only appeals to the group of people that is likely to want to use them - on Apple's site for example, everything is super simple and glossy but then there's a section labelled 'Tech Specs' for the experts that want to get into that
  * Note: Avoid 'advanced'. _"Labelling something as 'Advanced' informs the user she's not qualified to go there"_
* As a user is concentrating on a task, their _locus of attention narrows_ - make sure your visual cues for the features that are hidden away can be seen by your user on their relevant journey (but don't distract or get in the way)

<a name="part7"/>
#Part 7 - Displace
> If you understand the trade-offs, displacing the right roles to the right devices works well

* **Displace between devices** - what's easy on one platform can feel complex on another, so play to the strengths of each platform
  * e.g. Running apps gather information on a mobile device that you can take with you on your run, but often display the complex analysis of that information in a web browser where there is more viewing space
* List of mobile vs desktop strengths and weaknesses can be found on p. 164
* Another things you can displace is the  complexity - rather than displace it to another device you can **displace it to the user**
  * Keep your interface simple and let the user decide how to use your product, for example in a travel app they can choose to make lists of activities by location, type, family-friendliness, weather conditions and millions of other options; if you try to cater for all of them, it becomes incredibly complex but if you let the user make up their mind about how to use your product it remains simple and is possibly a lot more useful for the user
  * Allow users to _organise_ information _as they choose_
  * Allowing users to _set their own goals_ also helps the product _work both for novices and for experts_
* The key is to understand **which tasks to pass to the computer and which to leave for the user**:
  * Computers are good for things like accurate calculations, storing and sorting large data sets, following procedures and cross-referencing information
  * Users are good at setting goals, recognising information and choosing from small lists
* Design features that can be **used for several purposes**, for example, a basket that could double as a wishlist
* **Data entry is a sticking point** - don't force your users to stick to rigid data formats when entering data and let them do it in a way that is natural to them
* In order to displace you have to **trust your users** to actually do the tasks you're displacing to them so _user test_ your product!

#Part 8 - Before we go
> The secret to creating a simpple user experience is to shift the complexity into the right place, so that each moment feels simple

Should a task be automated? Should it have very specific and explicit controls? Should the steps of the task be completed all at once (registering for a service) or over time (customising an interface for your needs)?

* Pay attention to the details - a tiny frustration often becomes a frequent annoyance for your customers so it's worth putting in a day to fix it
* Simplicity means allowing the user enough space to fill in details from his/her life and make it personal
