I read a few books and I tend to take notes of the most interesting points (especially with technology books where I need quick reference), so I thought I'd collect them all here for now.

I have a separate repo for [Javascript the Good Parts](https://github.com/iteles/Javascript-the-Good-Parts) because this was my first set of markdown notes prior to deciding to put them all in one place.

Currently in this Book-notes repo, you will find notes on:
* [Professional Node js](https://github.com/iteles/Book-notes/blob/master/Professional-Node-js-notes.md) _by Pedro Teixeira_ [in progress]
* [Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer's Guide to Launching a Startup](https://github.com/iteles/Book-notes/blob/master/Start-Small-Stay-Small-notes.md) _by Rob Walling_, 2010 [Completed]
* [Simple & Usable - web, mobile & interaction design](https://github.com/iteles/Book-notes/blob/master/Simple-and-Usable-notes.md) _by Giles Colborne_, 2011 [Completed]
* [AngularJS](https://github.com/iteles/Book-notes/blob/master/AngularJS-nodes.md), _by Brad Green & Shyam Sheshadri_ [in progress]

For the books on technology that also require a little practice, I store all of the hands-on coding exercises I try out in my [gitbub learning repository](https://github.com/iteles/learning/tree/master/Professional-Node-js-exercises). I heavily comment the code as I go so there is a lot of information in those files as well.
